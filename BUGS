* A tag like <!tag "<hi"> can to generate a lots of headaches, because the
  first `>' is understanded like the close of the second `<'.

* Infinite recursivity with <!macro...> and with the `-p' flag activated,
  per example:
    <!macro a a>a
  also:
    <!macro a b>
    <!macro b a>a

* Infinite recursivity in the <!include ...>: when a htmlex file
  is include itself, or when multiple files are included between they
  (this already is very difficult to detect).

* <!exec ...> use `_stdout_.tmp' for store the temporary standard output,
  this will not be thus for two main reasons (and a lot more maybe)

  - in the active directory can exist a file with this name;

  - the user cannot have the necessary access to create this file;
