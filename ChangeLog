2003-02-23  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* htmlex.c (main): Reestructured arguments processing. Now is not

2003-02-21  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* htmlex.c, tags.c: Added "kill_comments" variable and an optional
	-k parameter to active this old behavior (thanks to Zaripov
	Michail for report that comments are necessary in some cases like
	javascripts).

2003-02-16  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

2003-02-10  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* htmlex.c, macros.c: Functional macros works perfectly.

2003-02-09  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* macros.c: Rewritten with a better API. Support for functional
	macros, now you can make customized tags (like C/C++ macros).

	* htmlex.c (own_strtok): Fixed the quotes inside quotes behavior
	(<!macro a "my \"macro\"">).
	(main): Fixed a little bug of illegal access to arguments.

2002-12-16  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Fixed the behavior to use arguments like:
	  htmlex -a hello -- file.htex bye
	  Now both arguments are passed:
	  <!arg1> = hello
	  <!arg2> = bye

2002-10-13  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Fixed the general <!if> behavior: now, the tags
	  in a false-if-block, aren't processing.
	* Fixed the <!elif ...> tag.
	* Fixed a terrible free-memory error in tag_include() of the
	  arguments which are passed to the included file. I can't
	  believe how the program doesn't crash all the other times.
	* Added -V and changed -v for two new verbose modes.

2002-03-15  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Fixed the `readme.txt' (to more understandable English): Thanks a
	  lot to Robert J Ohannessian for this.
	* Patch from Robert J Ohannessian: Renamed the prefix of all streams
	  stuff, from `s*' to `st*' (with this htmlex can be compiled with
	  Mingw without problems). Also, he makes some aesthetics changes
	  to the <!file-size> tag.

2002-01-03  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* I write the rest of the readme.txt file.
	* Eliminated a `warning' of gcc-3.0 in usage():
	  "multi-line string literals are deprecated".

2002-01-02  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Fixed a stupid bug in sseek(): changed the `return 0' to `break's
	  (thanks to Jorge Ramírez Flores).

2001-12-04  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Fixed some bugs with <!file-size> tag:
	  The buffer for the format was very-small.

2001-12-03  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* New tag <!dep file>.

2001-11-03  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* Added sort_macros: Now the macros with more long names
	  are in the beginning of `macros[]'.
	* Already the comments are skip.

2001-11-01  David Capello  <davidcapello@gmail.com>

	* All Perl code was removed.
	* Ready, in 5 days I make a program much better that I made in two
	  months, and though the code is a complete mess, I love it :-)
