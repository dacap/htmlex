INTRODUCTION
============

  htmlex is a small but powerful HTML preprocesor, which you can have some
  advantages relative to the conventional format of the .html files. Besides,
  as htmlex is fully compatible with the standard HTML syntax, you can use any
  HTML file that you have, and convert it to .htex.

FEATURES
========

  This program offer a set of extra-functions which are very useful and easy
  to use:
    - <!argX> to control the arguments which are passed to the file;
    - <!include> to include a entire fill within other;
    - <!macro> to create macros (a text that will be replaced with other);
    - <!exec> to execute extern programs and put its output;
    - <!if><!elif><!else><!fi> to control conditionals-blocks;
    - <!lc>, <!lcfirst>, <!uc>, <!ucfirst>, <!chop>, <!clean>, <!shift>,
      <!basename>, <!dir>, <!notdir>, <!suffix>, to control text strings
      and file names.
    - between others very useful like <!exists>, <!include-path> and
      <!macro-reset> (see the man page for more information).
